      When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to
      dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and
      to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to
      which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent
      respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the
      causes which impel them to the separation.
